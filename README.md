   <h1>Operation MacBook</h1>
 </details></details><p>I’ve written and rewritten this text more times than I care to admit. So now it’s an email.  I keep putting it off so I’m just gonna ask. I wasn’t going to say anything until I finished it but now…I need help.</p><p>I’m taking courses online. I had already planned to do this before my back ever went out. I’m not asking for money, I’m asking if I can “borrow” your outstanding credit score. I need a MacBook.</p><p>I was going to buy one outright while I was still working but then…</p></details><p>And my spine turned into a rice crispy treat.</p><p>The Maternal Unit™ has generously loaned me her laptop, but it simply cannot handle the scale of my upcoming projects. Not even close, not even a little bit, and not even at all. And I got one due Thursday.</p></details></details><p>I get a small discount at the Apple Store for being a student. I picked out the most affordable one with the specs closest to what I need. It’s $1099. I just need an Apple Card so I can make the monthly payments. I’m comfortable with pulling $300 out of my savings to cover the first 3 months of payments upfront.</p><p>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope. (But I understand if you say no. Absolutely no explanation needed.)</p></details><h2>FAQ</h2><details><summary>Why do I want a MacBook?</summary><p>Short form:</p><p>Portability</p><p>Unified memory</p><p>Neural engine</p><p>Cohesiveness</p></details><p>Long form:</p><p>Portability- A whole desktop situation seems like overkill. I’d have to buy all the accessories, and I need to be able to show off that bad boy on campus every so often.</p></details></details><p>Unified memory- I require equal amounts of usage from the CPU and GPU and Mac’s unified memory not only fosters a beautiful relationship between the two, but it also picks up some of the slack for what I’m giving up in memory. Ideally, I’d have 24-32GB but I can make 16GB work with the unified memory and my current applications. Once I get into development, I will require an upgrade, but I won’t have to think about that until next year. That’s a problem for future me. *See attachment for specs.</p><p>Neural Engine- It almost speaks for itself. It’s specifically designed to accommodate and accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. This is relevant.</p><p>Cohesiveness- I utilize my phone and my iPad- especially my iPad- in tandem with the laptop. The convenience of having all my devices “talking” to each other cannot be understated.</p></details><details><summary>What am I studying?</summary><p>I’m currently doing an online certification in Data Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.  I’m also pursuing an associate’s degree in AI at Hillsborough Community College starting May 12th.</p><p>I’m going in heavy on the certification program but going easy on the collegiate level. I’m starting with an algebra course and one other (TBD) and going from there. If I find I can handle the workload, I’ll enroll in more courses in the Fall Semester.</p></details><details><summary>What made me decide to study AI?</summary><p>That wasn’t the ORIGINAL plan. The plan was to study conversational Spanish as well as Logistics, Supply Chain Management and Transportation. I like big trucks and can NOT lie. However, under recent circumstances, I was motivated to pivot. I enjoy AI, I use it every day for both practical and creative purposes and I’ve dabbled in prompt engineering. I have some ideas for future development and patents. It’s also something that is guaranteed to be lucrative.</p></details><details><summary>My goals?</summary><p>The short-term goal is to be proficient enough at AI application and machine learning to turn it into a marketable and highly sought-after job skill. On my current track, I should be able to accomplish this in 3 months while also continuing my education beyond that. The certification courses that I’m attending are very hands-on and that’s where I shine.</p><p>In approximately 9 months, I should be something of an expert in applied AI. HOWEVER, prior to that, I plan to apply to Microsoft Leap in August so that I might get PAID to further my education rather than the other way around.</p><p>For my long-term goals, I endeavor to take on the title of AI Engineer. However, this requires a COLLEGE DEGREE to be taken seriously as a developer. I don’t like that. I hate essays. And exams. And classrooms.  So, we’ll see. Maybe I’ll find a way around that.</p></details><details><summary>Doesn’t this career path require a great deal of math? Aren’t you notorious for being a mathematical failure?</summary><p>Dead men tell no tales…and neither does my high school transcript (I have it in hand if you want to re-live the trauma). The only math I actually need is algebra. I was rather proficient at that when I put in the effort.</p><p>Furthermore, I only need college-level algebra for the associate’s degree and not the certification. I can code just fine without it.</p></details><details><summary>How am I paying for this lofty education?</summary><p>The online certification has already been paid for out of my shallow pockets in advance. The college level courses are covered by a combination of federal aid, state grants and renewable scholarships. (Yes, I am eligible for a few scholarships, SHOCKING. Ya boi did the research and the time.) It’s practically free.</p></details><details><summary>How does this affect my current student loans?</summary><p>Whilst attending federally approved college or technical courses, I’m under no legal obligation to pay back my student loans. Tis the law. They will “freeze” until I’m no longer in school. They will not accrue interest; they will not pass “GO” and they will not collect $200. Not from me anyways.</p></details><p>My backup plan should you deny my humble (and humiliating) request:</p><p>I shall prostate myself before the Maternal Unit™ and beg to sell or trade-in her over-priced, under-performing “gaming” laptop to reduce the cost of the MacBook. Best Buy has some older, refurbished models at the same price…</p><p>…And I’ve given the maternal unit a not unsubstantial amount of monetary aid earlier this year. So…I got leverage? Makes me feel gross. Prostrating before Paternal Unit™ is slightly more digestible.</p></details></details><p>This concludes my proposal. Thank you for your consideration, I eagerly await your response.</p></details><p>With the utmost regards to my elderly cone,</p><p>Nikolas J. Zonis</p><p>“The path you are on has come to an end.
