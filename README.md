     <h1>Operation MacBook: A Modest Proposal</h1>
     <p>I’ve written and rewritten this text more times than I care to admit. So then it was an email. Now it's a temporary webpage. WELCOME!
     I keep putting it off so I’m just gonna ask. I wasn’t going to say anything until I finished it but now…I need help.</p>
 
     <p>I’m taking courses online. I had already planned to do this before my back ever went out.
     I’m not asking for money, I’m asking if I can “borrow” your outstanding credit score. I need a MacBook.</p>
 
     <p>I was going to buy one outright while I was still working but then…</p>
 
     <img src="image_0.gif" alt="GIF 0" class="gif"/>
 
     <p>And my spine turned into a rice crispy treat.
     The Maternal Unit™ has generously loaned me her laptop, but it simply cannot handle the scale of my upcoming projects.
     Not even close, not even a little bit, and not even at all. And I got one due Thursday.</p>
 
     <p>I get a small discount at the Apple Store for being a student. I picked out the most affordable one with the specs closest to what I need. It’s $1099. 
     I just need an Apple Card so I can make the monthly payments. I’m comfortable with pulling $300 out of my savings to cover the first 3 months of payments upfront.</p>
 
     <p><strong>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.</strong> (But I understand if you say no. Absolutely no explanation needed.)</p>
 
     <h2>FAQ</h2>
     <details>
         <summary>Why do I want a MacBook?</summary>
         <p><strong>Short form:</strong><br>
         Portability, Unified memory, Neural engine, Cohesiveness</p>
         <p><strong>Long form:</strong><br>
         Portability - A whole desktop situation seems like overkill...<br><br>
         Unified memory - I require equal amounts of usage from the CPU and GPU...<br><br>
         Neural Engine - It almost speaks for itself...<br><br>
         Cohesiveness - I utilize my phone and my iPad...<br>
         </p>

     <details>
         <summary>What am I studying?</summary>
         <p>I’m currently doing an online certification in Data Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence...<br>
         Starting with algebra and one other course at Hillsborough Community College on May 12th...</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>What made me decide to study AI?</summary>
         <p>The plan was Spanish + Logistics. But I pivoted... I enjoy AI, use it every day, and have ideas for development and patents.</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>My goals?</summary>
         <p>Short-term: Proficiency in AI application & ML = job skills in 3 months.<br>
         Long-term: Become an AI Engineer (eventually with a degree...maybe).</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>Doesn’t this career path require a lot of math?</summary>
         <p>I only need algebra. I was good at it when I tried. I can code just fine without it.</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>How am I paying for all this?</summary>
         <p>Certification is prepaid. College covered by aid and scholarships. Practically free.</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>What about current student loans?</summary>
         <p>While attending school, loans are frozen. No interest, no payments.</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>Backup plan?</summary>
         <p>Beg the Maternal Unit™ to sell/trade-in her gaming laptop. I’ve helped her financially before, so... leverage?</p>
     </details>
 
     <details>
         <summary>Am I having a manic episode?</summary>
         <p>Yes. Hyper productive. Last one = CDL + trip to Wisconsin. Worth it.</p>
